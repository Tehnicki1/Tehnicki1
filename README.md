  Hey! I'm ykela — just getting started in the world of cybersecurity and reverse engineering.  
  I’m learning how to analyze malware, mess with games, dig into Java apps, and do some basic OSINT investigations.

<p align="center">
  Right now, I’m mostly experimenting, breaking things (on purpose), and trying to understand how stuff really works under the hood.  
  I’m not an expert — just really curious and always trying to level up.
